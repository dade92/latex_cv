%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I was born in Erba, a small town in the north of Italy, and I got fond of computers since high school, when I started to study C and then Java by myself. After graduation, it was clear for me that I had to improve my knowledge in the field of computer science, so I enrolled in the course of Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. During my university career I had the opportunity to study other programming languages and exciting subjects such as Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence or Cryptography, that increased my interest in the field of Computer Science.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
