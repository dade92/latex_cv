%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I was born in Erba, a small town in the north of Italy, and I got fond of computers since high school, when I started to study C and then Java by myself. After graduation, it was clear for me that I had to improve my knowledge in the field of computer science, so I enrolled in the course of Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, obtaining a master degree in 2017}

\section{Tech competences (in a nutshell)}
\newline
During my professional experience, I' ve grown in a complete agile environment, using scrum methods like kanban/sprint and practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming. \newline 
About hard skills: I was born as a backend \emph{Java/Kotlin} developer, shifting during time to a more T-shaped figure, studying technologies outside my first area of interest like frontend frameworks (\emph{React}) devOps tools (\emph{Docker}) and some basic concepts about orchestration systems (\emph{Kubernetes}), all technologies that I used or got in touch during my career at Lastminute.com to deploy in production a valuable product.\newline
About observability, I used \emph{Grafana} for monitoring and \emph{Graylog} for logging.\newline

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
